# Atomic Commits

Every task follows this rhythm: **plan, then repeat (implement one thing → verify → commit).**

## 1. Plan

Before coding, break the task into atomic steps. List them. Each step is one logical change — one concern, one purpose. The codebase must work after each step.

## 2. Implement → Verify → Commit (repeat for each step)

Do one step. Verify it works. Commit it. Move to the next.

**One commit = one logical change.** Not two things. Not "a feature and its tests." Not "a rename and a behavior change." One thing.

Commit instructions are found in [`.github/copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions.md`](../../.github/copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions.md). Follow them for clear, consistent commit messages.

Stage only the files that belong to that change. Never `--no-verify`.

## 3. Stay honest

- If a step should split further, split it.
- If tests break from your change, fix them in the same commit — the unit isn't done until it works.
- Never amend a previous atomic commit to sneak in more changes. Make a new commit.
